In this project I create the well known game called Ships using modern JavaScript,and for this I've used locally stored data, simulating a JSON object that might come from an Api.
Using the data,I have created the layout, added event listeners for checking if the coordinates clicked by the user are hits/missed and changing the layout based on this.
For this app I use concepts like, array/object destructuring, spread operator, event listeners, higher order functions,etc.
